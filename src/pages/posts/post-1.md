# My First Blog Post

Published on: 31-08-2023

Welcome to mi new blog about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I create a new Astro project and set up my oonline accounts.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
